Going forward, this T20 tournament will enhance the profile of the players, ensure their longevity, and provide a platform to pick a lot more players in the future.

A bowler can get to bowl three times afresh. A batsman can record three scores. A bowler can bowl a maximum of four overs in each of the T20 matches and two overs in the T10 match for a total of 10 overs. If Team A wins the first game, loses the second to B, but manages to win the third, the winning result of the match will be 2-1.  The idea is to create more opportunities for cricketers, and each 50-over match will be of six-hour duration. This will also create more excitement for a 50 over format.

In cricket, there was one such person who achieved many landmarks being the darling of the players in his team. He was born on November 21, 1870, and his name popped up on my screen while screening for some cricket details that I was looking for.The man whom everyone addressed as Darling was Australian captain Joe Darling, who captained them to victory over arch rivals England in 1899 and 1902.  He is the pride of all left-handed batsmen since he was the first left-hander to crack a century in Test cricket when he scored 101 against England in the first Test at Sydney in 1897.   Despite his century, England won the match by nine wickets. England emerged triumphant mainly because of Indian-born KS Ranjitsinhji, who used to play for England, cracked 175 runs.",

In the 1897-98 Ashes series, he became the first batsman to score 500 runs in a Test series when he piled up 537 runs. There are many more interesting events related to Darling. In 1905, he captained a match on November 21, which also happened to be the birthday of England skipper Stanley Jackson. This was the first time in the history of cricket that two opposing captains shared the same date, month and year of birth. Jackson was always lucky with the toss, and in 1905 he won all tosses in the five matches of the series. ",
