                  1. How does spacenartists.com stand out and what is the USP of
                  the portal?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Spacenartists.com directly connects an artist with an end
                  user. Unlike other freelancer or B2B portals, we do not
                  intervene or hide the contact details of our subscribers. You
                  are free to communicate directly through any of the
                  communication channels listed on the profile. What also makes
                  spacenartists.com stand out is that we don’t charge commission
                  on transactions. The idea is to assist you in reaching out the
                  to the right audiences, which we call our marketplace.

                  2. How does it help me when there multiple profiles from the
                  same industry? For example, multiple graphic artists?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Each profile has a mandatory review option which improves your
                  chances of being contacted by clients. This also allows you to
                  stand out against your competition. It is also a well-known
                  fact that a client will never dismiss one artist unless they
                  secure multiple options for themselves.

                  5. I get the same exposure through LinkedIn, Facebook or
                  Instagram? Why should I pay spacenartists.com?
                </h4>
                <p>Let’s answer this one at a time:</p>
                <p>
                  LinkedIn does not allow you to contact other profiles directly
                  without a subscription. You need to send an invite and it is
                  up to the connection to either reject or accept your request.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Facebook cannot be treated as a professional platform for
                  businesses keeping in mind that not everyone is comfortable
                  sharing business information through Facebook.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Instagram stories and posts are good enough but are not
                  effective when it comes to a B2B or B2C requirement.
